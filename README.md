## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ä°brahim Can

I'm a full-stack engineer who builds scalable, secure, and robust systems â€” with precision and care for the unseen details.

### ðŸ§  Philosophy

> "I approach software like engineering â€” not just to make it work, but to make it make sense."

### ðŸ”’ About My Work

Most of my work is private by design â€” security-sensitive, business-oriented, and tailored for real-world usage.  
However, I care deeply about code quality, performance, and clear logic â€” and I bring that mindset into everything I build.
